      <p class="mb-4"style="text-align:justify;">Dried meat has been around for centuries and its history can be traced to plenty of different cultures. Biltong, specifically, was first created by the indigenous people of South Africa over 400 years ago. They preserved their meat by curing it with salt and hanging it to dry. Although at that time it wasn't known as Biltong.</p>

<p class="mb-4"style="text-align:justify;">When the European settlers arrived, they introduced a more sophisticated curing process that involved vinegar and spices such as pepper and coriander. That is how Biltong was born. The word Biltong is derived from the Dutch words "bil" (meat or rump) and "tong" (strip), so essentially Biltong means strip of beef.</p>

<p class="mb-4"style="text-align:justify;">Biltong became an important part of sea travel due to its durability and later played a very important role in the migration of the Dutch settlers, or Voortrekkers, as they traveled further North. Biltong was the perfect travel snack because of how long it lasts, its health benefits, and the lean protein it provides (how's that for Paleo!) Biltong has always been an integral part of South African culture and is a staple food that can be found in every butcher shop and supermarket.</p>

        <p>The drying methods also separate the flavour of jerky and biltong, leaving biltong with a distinct meat taste and jerky a lingering "smokey taste". These drying methods also alter the texture of the meat. As jerky contains very little fat the resulting texture is tougher, giving a "steak-like chew".<p>

     <p style="text-align:justify;">The meat is marinated in vinegar & various spices. All spices come from South Africa. A very tasty product! Finally, after being sliced into sticks, manufactured into sausage, or cut into big pieces, the meat is placed in a specific drying machine, for 2 to 5 days. When the drying process is complete, the meat is called biltong. In slices, sticks or sausage, it comes in several forms and you can consume it as you wish.</p>
