      <p class="mb-4"style="text-align:justify;">Tere siga is a traditional African dish originating from Ethiopia. The name of the dish is translated as raw meat, and that's exactly what it consists of – raw meat that's typically cut off a cow carcass and served with mitmita (powdered hot spice blend), awaze (hot dipping sauce), and senafich (mustard sauce). Tere siga is one of the few Ethiopian dishes that are eaten with utensils, and the ritual of cutting the meat is a huge part of the meal. This ritual is known as q'wirt, meaning to cut. The dish is traditionally served at butcher houses, and it's accompanied by injera flatbread on the side.</p>

        <p>Ethiopian tere siga typically comes from grass-fed beef, Ethiopian says, which gives it a different flavor and texture. In Ethiopia, "the flavors are concentrated. An extreme example would be like eating a grape versus a raisin.”<p>

     <p style="text-align:justify;">The Ethiopian dish known as tere siga offers exactly what it promises. Translating to “raw meat,” the meal consists of thick strips of just that: raw meat, usually cut off a hanging carcass (most often, a cow), served with a fiery spice blend (mitmita) and a small bowl of a runny, spicy mustard sauce (senafich). And, of course, there is injera, the vessel most commonly used to transport Ethiopian foods from plate to mouth.</p>
