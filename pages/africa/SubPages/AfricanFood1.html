      <p class="mb-4"style="text-align:justify;">Popularly known as ‘amancimbi’ in Ndebele or ‘madora’ in Shona, mopane worms have been a good source of protein for generations across Southern Africa. The worm is really a large caterpillar belonging to the Gonimbrasia belina species, more commonly known as the Emperor moth. It is named ‘mopane’ because it feeds on the leaves of mopane trees after it hatches in summer, and can only be found in southern African countries.</p>
      <p class="mb-4"style="text-align:justify;">According to Food and Agriculture Association (FAO) the mopane caterpillar is one of the best-known and most economically-important forestry resource products of the mopane woodlands in southern Zimbabwe, Botswana and northern South Africa. It has been estimated that annually 9.5 billion mopane larvae are harvested in Southern Africa’s 20,000km2 of mopane forest worth US$85 million, of which approximately 40 per cent goes to producers who are primarily women from poorer, rural areas.</p>

        <p>If you travel around rural southern Africa, you're likely to come across mopane worms, either canned or at a market. We've found the taste described as “burned steak”, “crunchy and salty” (as anything will taste if you fry it, surely) and, of course, “butter and peanuts”.<p>
