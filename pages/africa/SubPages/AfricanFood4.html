     <h2 class="mb-4 tm-text-color-primary">Cooking Ostrich Egg Omelette</h2>
     <p style="text-align:justify;">Use the back of a knife to crack the shell of the ostrich egg, being careful with your fingers. Pour the egg into a large mixing bowl.
Add diced red bell pepper, diced spring onion, milk, salt and pepper to the mixing bowl.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Using a whisk, give the mixture a good mix to bring the ingredients together.
On a low heat, add the knobs of butter to a frying pan until melted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Gently pour in the omelette mixture, moving the mixture from the edges in the beginning until it begins to set.
Once one side has set enough to get leverage underneath with a spatula, flip it over so that it can cook on both sides. It should only take 2 minutes for the mixture to be flippable.
Add your cheddar cheese on top, spread evenly so that it melts through.
Cook for a further 2 minutes. Check that it is thoroughly cooked by poking with a knife and ensuring there are no watery bits still lingering in the pan.
Once it is cooked, flip half of the omelette onto the other half to create a semi-circle and remove from the pan to the plate.
Season with thyme and additional salt and pepper to taste.</p>
