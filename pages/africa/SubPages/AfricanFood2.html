      <p class="mb-4"style="text-align:justify;">There are scores of foods whose deadliness equals their deliciousness. In Namibia, the giant African bullfrogs (Pyxicephalus adspersus) locally known as efuma or omafuma are considered a delicacy, even though eating them results in possible kidney failures or what the locals call Oshiketakata.
The bullfrogs are eaten, especially during the rainy season. According to reports, apart from the people who eat the bullfrogs within Namibia, there are others in southern Africa who enjoy the delicacy.Reportedly, the Nsenga people in the eastern Luangwa Valley (Eastern Province, Zambia) also consume whole bullfrogs.While the dangers can usually be avoided through proper preparation, its association with danger is irresistible to adventurous diners. People are generally advised to dine “after the third rain” or when the bullfrogs start croaking and breeding.
The unpleasant-looking specimen grows to the size of a housecat and it contains enough poison to be lethal. However, the lovers of these foods argue that deliciousness outweighs the danger.</p>

      <p class="tm-text-color-white small tm-font-thin mb-0">Mopane worms are a staple part of the diet in rural areas and are considered a delicacy in the cities. They can be eaten dry, as crunchy as potato chips, or cooked and drenched in sauce. .It's called a mopane worm because it feeds on the leaves of mopane trees after it hatches in summer.</p>

     <p style="text-align:justify;">Rinse frogs under cold running water. Set aside.

In medium-sized soup pot or saute pan, bring dashi to steady simmer. Place washed frogs in pot and simmer for 10 minutes.

Add miso paste to pot and incorporate into broth by pressing miso paste against edge of soup pot. Simmer for 5 minutes longer, until frog flesh is cooked through but still very tender. Add wakame to pot and let soften in broth.
