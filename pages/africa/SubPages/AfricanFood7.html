      <p class="mb-4"style="text-align:justify;">On the outskirts of Cape Town, South Africa, people in the township of Langa make the most out of butchers’ leftovers. But even those accustomed to dining on brains might be surprised when they come face-to-face with these grinning decapitated sheep heads.
Affectionately dubbed “smiley,” this township specialty gets its signature look from the process of singeing the hair from the sheep’s head with a searing-hot metal rod. As the skin heats, dries, and shrinks, the animal’s lips pull back to reveal an ear-to-ear grin.</p>

<p class="mb-4"style="text-align:justify;">While preparation varies, the head is usually cleaved along its length to remove the brain, then roasted over a fire or broiled in hot, drum-like ovens. Butchers might carve par-cooked meat off of the face for mixing into curry or for grilling in the South African barbecue style known as braai. Fully-roasted smiley can be picked apart by hand. Because the cuts of meat that fetch the highest prices come from the neck down, smiley and other cranial specialties are part of a utilitarian approach to feeding one’s family. Using body parts such as the head can be an inexpensive and innovative way to add flavor and protein to dinner.</p>

      <p class="tm-text-color-white small tm-font-thin mb-0">This dish might not appeal to everyone but it’s served countrywide and especially loved by locals in rural areas. Boiled sheep’s head, or “smiley” as it’s known in South Africa – due to the grimace on the sheep’s face, is a traditional Xhosa dish. The head is often served whole, but can also be cut up and the meat used in stews or accompanied by side dishes.</p>

        <p>People like the ears. They say it's chewy, says by the locals. For many customers, the best part is the eyes. It?s a delicacy. Like an oyster is to you, that's how a sheep eye is to them.<p>

     <p style="text-align:justify;">Smiley (Sheep Head) are broiled in large drums, and then charred with heated metal rods to get rid of the fur. Some cooks first strip the head of the fur, wash it, parboil it in vats, and then roast it over hot coals. It may also be boiled and then roasted in the oven. Regardless of cooking method, you'll get a golden brown grinning sheep's head.</p>
