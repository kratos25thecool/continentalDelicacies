                        <h1>Deep Fried Mixed Worms</h1>
                        <p>Many foreigners may shudder at the thought of eating worms, but they aren't considered creepy or crawly in Yunnan. Beijing's Middle 8th makes the little critters delicious rather than simply a novelty.
                        <br><br>
                        Tasty worms, plus a menu chock full of other Yunnan classics, have helped the chain earn repeat tiles in the Best Yunnan category of the Beijinger's annual Reader Restaurant Awards. They're up for that accolade again this year, and you can vote for them (and your other favorite restaurants) until polling closes tonight (March 8) here.
                        <br><br>
                         From its origins in Sanlitun, Middle 8th has since expanded to five locations -- two in Sanlitun (in 3.3 and Tai Koo Li), one in Zhonnguancun, one in Indigo Mall, and another in Xizhimen.

                        Yunnanâ€™s has a rich culinary culture of dining on worms (read more here and here), and Middle 8th is a great place for a worm newbie to start. The Worm Eating Leaves (RMB 39), which features fried bamboo worms with pea sprouts, is essentially a salad, with the worms playing the part of croutons. They have a slightly brittle crunch plus a soft chewiness which complements crisp the pea shoot leaves well.
