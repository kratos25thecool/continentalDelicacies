                <h3>Spicy Raw Ant Eggs Salad</h3>
                <p>Does it look familiar to you? Yes, this dish from northern Thai cuisine (Isan) is similar to Larb (spicy minced meat salad) or Som Tam (spicy green papaya salad) but made with the eggs of red ants. Again another protein rich fare as you may have guessed, fatty and sweet but terribly spicy.

                <h3>Balut</h3>
                <p>Balut is considered to be one of the first exotic food delicacies of the Philippines. Inspired by Chinese culture, balut dates back to almost 200 years ago. What once was considered a high-class dish is now enjoyed with a cold beer. It's as casual as an ice cream on a hot summer day and as pivotal an inclusion in the Philippines as ketchup is on a hot dog.

                <h3>Crispy Fried Scorpions</h3>
                <p>Thai people love street food and we love it too. No matter where you are in Thailand, in busy Bangkok or in the countryside, you can find the food everywhere you look. You can’t possibly get hungry in The Land Of Smiles! While Pad Thai and Tom Yum are tasty, Thai food is much more than that. This post is all about eating bugs in Thailand, including fried scorpion, fried crickets, fried grasshoppers, and more.

                <h3>Deep Fried Mixed Worms</h3>
                <p>Honestly I have wanted to try worms for a long time, ever since I watched Timon and Pumbaa eating succulent worms in the jungle. The reality is they do taste of protein but aren’t as juicy as I expected. Yet the crunchy texture and deep-fried oily taste certainly make it a good pairing for beers.

                <h3>Chicken Heart & Liver Sashimi</h3>
                <p>Speaking of raw food, this is a must-eat and an all-time favourite of mine at yakitori places in Japan. Believe it or not, in my opinion chicken sashimi is better than the usual fish variation. The chicken breast sashimi is surprisingly sweet while the heart and liver are fresh and crisp. You can never see this outside Japan. The dish is just beyond words and I guarantee you won’t regret trying!

                <h3>Grilled Chicken Uterus with Proto-Egg</h3>
                <p>Chochin means lantern in Japanese which represents this skewer of undeveloped egg hanging from the uterus. This is an even rarer find in Japan than chicken sashimi because of the skills required to cook it. However if you see it on the menu or at the bar, you must not miss it as it’s just simply wonderful. Be mindful of the hot runny egg yolk bursting in your mouth!
