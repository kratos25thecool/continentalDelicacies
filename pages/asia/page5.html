                        <h1>Chicken Heart & Liver Sashimi</h1>
                        <p>When you’re ready to try some of the most exotic foods on the planet, there’s no substitute for nihon ryori, also known as Japanese cuisine. Everyone’s familiar with old staples like fugu fish, traditional sushi, and natto, but have you ever thought to try torisashi? As a person that loves Japanese cooking and who has studied the language and the culture for years, until recently, I had never tried this uniquely Japanese dish, but now that I have, I realize that I didn’t know what I was missing.
                            <br><br>
                         For those that have never heard of the poultry dish, torisashi is a compound word – tori, which is the Japanese word for chicken or bird, and sashi, which you may recognize from the Japanese dish sashimi. If you haven’t figured it out by now, torisashi is thinly sliced, raw or nearly raw chicken!
                         <br><br>
                         You’re probably thinking that you’ve only heard that the Japanese love their fish raw, but the fact of the matter is that there are a number of local dishes throughout Japan that use fresh or aged raw meats. For example, bashashi is a sashsimi’d up version of horse meat that is becoming very popular in some districts and towns throughout the island nation.

                        When it comes to torisashi, this particular dish seems to have its most fervent fans in the Kagoshima prefecture, which is located on the island of Kyushu. With so much plentiful seafood in the area, it’s amazing that many in this prefecture enjoy so many varieties of sashimi and other dishes that originate from purely terrestrial animals, but clearly there’s great demand here.

                        his chicken dish is often served similarly to traditional sashimi, which means that you will be able to eat it with ginger, wasabi, and a variety of other sushi-friendly sauces. In addition to the sauces, green onion, garlic, sesame seeds and salt are often used to make the dish pop for diners, so don’t just expect to taste the chicken itself – the dish is heavily seasoned so that your palate will definitely experience some truly unique flavors.

                        When it comes to the texture of the dish, most forms of torisashi have a very soft and chewy texture, but if you opt to sear it slightly, it ends up taking on a bit more tenderness
