                        <h1>Crispy Fried Scorpions</h1>
                        <p>Thai people love street food and we love it too. No matter where you are in Thailand, in busy Bangkok or in the countryside, you can find the food everywhere you look. You can’t possibly get hungry in The Land Of Smiles! While Pad Thai and Tom Yum are tasty, Thai food is much more than that. This post is all about eating bugs in Thailand, including fried scorpion, fried crickets, fried grasshoppers, and more.

                        Surprisingly, it’s not that easy to buy edible bugs in Thailand. In fact, we spent a few weeks looking for them and we finally got lucky on the Chiang Mai night market. Later in this article, I will give you the list of specific locations of where to buy insects in Thailand.

                        That’s probably the most exotic food in Thailand. Scorpion on a stick looks quite scary but it’s surprisingly tasty!

                        If you wonder what do scorpions taste like, just think about the crispy french fries. The taste is very similar, however edible scorpion is much healthier.

                        There are many benefits of eating scorpions, the most important one is supplying the body with nutrients. Scorpion meat consists of over 50% protein!

                        Some people say that eating scorpions and other bugs may be one of the solutions to the world hunger problem.
