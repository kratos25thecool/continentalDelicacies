                        <p>
                            Yakitori (焼き鳥) are grilled chicken skewers made from bite sized pieces of meat from all different parts of the chicken, such as the breasts, thighs, skin, liver and other innards. Usually made to order and cooked over charcoal, yakitori is a popular, inexpensive dish commonly enjoyed together with a glass of beer. The best yakitori is served at specialty restaurants, known as yakitori-ya, but it can also be found at many other types of restaurants across Japan, such as izakaya, and at festival food stands.

                            Chochin means lantern in Japanese which represents this skewer of undeveloped egg hanging from the uterus. This is an even rarer find in Japan than chicken sashimi because of the skills required to cook it. However if you see it on the menu or at the bar, you must not miss it as it’s just simply wonderful. Be mindful of the hot runny egg yolk bursting in your mouth!
