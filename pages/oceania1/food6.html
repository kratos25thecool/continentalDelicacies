      <p class="mb-4"style="text-align:justify;">According to AgriFutures Australia the main product of crocodile farms is skins, which are mostly exported used to produce premium leather used for fashion accessories.  Crocodile meat is sold domestically and exported. It  is considered a succulent white meat that is low in fat and high in protein. Because of its low fat content it is best cooked like lean pork or chicken. Crocodile meat has begun to appear in more restaurants as a result of a renewed interest in Australian indigenous foods.</p>

        <p>The crocodile meat is always has a texture like large fish. The meat is segmented and easily divisible when cooked. As far as flavour goes, if it came from captivity in a crocodile farm it usually tastes like chicken because it's been fed chicken. If it was caught from a reserve then it will taste more like fish.<p>

     <h2 class="mb-4 tm-text-color-primary">Method of Cooking</h2>
     <p style="text-align:justify;">First prepare your marinade by combining the chopped red chilli, light soy sauce, chopped garlic, grated ginger, cayenne, salt and pepper, and mixing well.
Now cut your meat in to generous cube chunks and drop them in to the mixture making sure they receive a good coating. Leave in the fridge to marinate for at least 2 hours, preferably longer if you have time.
10 minutes before you're ready to take the meat out of the fridge, soak your bamboo skewer sticks in water to prevent them from burning.
For the most authentic flavour prepare a barbecue, but if you don't have a barbecue then a grill will work fine.
Start adding your meat to the skewers along with the chopped green pepper, onion and button mushrooms.
Place the skewers on to the grill and begin cooking. They should only take 5 or so minutes, making sure to turn them once or twice to ensure an even cooking.
Halfway through cooking, feel free to add an extra dose to the meat if you feel it needs it.
Take off the grill, squeeze the juice of a lime on top, and serve on its own or with pita bread & salad to make a kebab.
Enjoy!</p>
