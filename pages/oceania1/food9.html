      <p class="mb-4"style="text-align:justify;">Historically, Oka i’a is what Samoans call their version of ceviche or fish salad.  A raw fish salad is one of my favorite things.  Each family likely has their own recipe for this dish.  Feel free to use what ingredients you like best however fresh fish, coconut and citrus is a must. Other countries have variations of this same dish.  In Fiji it is called kokoda, Tahitians call it poisson cru and in Hawaii it is called poke. You really don’t need to marinate the fish in the citrus very long, just enough for it to turn slightly opaque.  The citrus cooks it in just a couple of minutes.  Don’t be afraid to try it, if you use fresh fish there is nothing fishy tasting about it at all.  Simply a delicious bite.  You can also serve it with some fresh taro root chips which would be totally authentic.</p>

      <p class="tm-text-color-white small tm-font-thin mb-0">Oka i'a is a Samoan dish consisting of raw fish, usually fresh tuna that is marinated in lemon juice and coconut cream, then served in chunks with onions. The combination of these ingredients makes for an extremely healthy, flavorful, and unique fish salad.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">With the first taste of Oka i'a we can understood the Samoans' love for it. Certainly it suggested a citrus and vinegarly, but with something added, a strong, rich whiff of the mystery and fecundity of the ocean depths they can say that Oka i'a is must a try food in Samoan.<p>

     <p style="text-align:justify;">Marinate the snapper and onion in lemon juice and leave in the fridge until it turns white and opaque (About 3 hours or it can be left overnight in the fridge). Just before serving drain off the juices and mix in the diced tomatoes, spring onion, and salt to taste. Pour over 1/4 cup of coconut milk. It can be served immediately or put back in the fridge to chill for a little while.</p>
