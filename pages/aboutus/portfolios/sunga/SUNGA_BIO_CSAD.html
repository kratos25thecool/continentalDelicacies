</div><p><blockquote>  <b>Childhood memories</b> are very important in our lives.<sup>1</sup> It makes us remember the best times of our lives.<sup>2</sup> They shape our thinking and future.<sup>3</sup> Growing up, I had a very loving family.<sup>4</sup> I had one sibling with whom I used to play a lot.<sup>5</sup> I remember very fondly the games we use to play.<sup>6</sup> Especially, in the evenings, we used to go out in the park with our sports equipment.<sup>7</sup> Each day we played different games, for example, football on one day and cricket on the other.<sup>8</sup> These memories of playing in the park are very dear to me.<sup>9</sup>
	Furthermore, I remember clearly the aroma of my grandmother’s homemade <i><q>atchara</q></i>.<sup>10</sup> I used to help her whenever she made <i><q>atchara</q></i>.<sup>11</sup> We used to watch her do the magic of combining the oils and spices to make delicious <i><q>atchara</q></i>.<sup>12</sup> Even today, I can sometimes smell her <i><q>atchara</q></i> whenever I look back at this memory.<sup>13</sup>
	Most importantly, I remember this instance very clearly when we went out for a picnic with my family.<sup>14</sup> We paid a visit to the zoo and had an incredible day.<sup>15</sup> My mother packed delectable dishes which we ate in the zoo.<sup>16</sup> My father clicked so many pictures that day.<sup>17</sup> When I look at these pictures, the memory is so clear, it seems like it happened just yesterday.<sup>18</sup> Thus, my childhood memories are very dear to me and make me smile when I feel low.<sup>19</sup>. I would treasure this childhood memories for the rest of my life.<sup>20</sup><a href="#top"><p>Go Top</p></a>

	I remember falling in love for the first time with a girl and escaping from my house at night to see her.<sup>10</sup> It was during this time that we as a family received the news that my grandmother was sick.<sup>11</sup> I remember how we had to unite and be strong as a family to help my grandmother go through those hard moments and this made my view about my family change.<sup>12</sup> But ultimately my grandmother died.<sup>13</sup>
	Becuase of this, I started to appreciate what I had. <sup>14</sup>  My second year was filled with no real preoccupations, parties, friends, and all the typical teenage stuff.<sup>15</sup> I started to watch how many of my friends, who were seniors from the preview year, started to leave for college.<sup>16</sup> I really missed them at the beginning of the year, but as time passed I got used to not having them around.<sup>17</sup> When I look back, the memory is so clear, it seems like it happened just yesterday.<sup>18</sup> Many have left and many others have arrived, and even though we are not together in school anymore, we continue being the big family we have always been.<sup>19</sup>. These are the people, memories, and feelings that I will always remember and I will carry with me wherever I go.<sup>20</sup><a href="#top"><p>Go Top</p></a>

	Join any clubs you find interesting. <sup>11</sup> If they take up too much time, you can always quit them later! And they’re also a great way to met people.<sup>12</sup>  Make time to study.<sup>13</sup> It can be easy to get caught up going out and meeting people, but college classes move at a far faster pace than high school classes, so falling behind is doubly stressful.<sup>14</sup> Find quiet places outside your room to study.<sup>15</sup>
	Remember to get enough sleep, and look after yourself! <sup>16</sup>  College makes you a stronger, more complete person.<sup>17</sup> It might be difficult at first, but It has provided me with the necessary tools to enhance my skills more.<sup>18</sup> College taught me valuable knowledge about this diverse world and people and concepts in general and eventually will enable me to hopefully become more successful in life when I finally graduate and get my degree.<sup>19</sup> All these aspects of college have made me more well-rounded as a person.<sup>20</sup><a href="#top"><p>Go Top</p></a>
