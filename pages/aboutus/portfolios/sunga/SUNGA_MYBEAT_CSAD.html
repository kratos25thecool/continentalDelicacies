    <div><h2>R&B</h2>
      <p><blockquote>
        R&B stands for rhythm and blues. It is a music genre whose origin is from African American cultures. The genre has changed a lot since its origin in the 1940s. The style for R&B music is usually soulful and moving. The R&B music that is pre-dominant now is contemporary R&B. it is not necessarily the same as the original R&B because it is a combination of pop, hip hop and funk. R&B basically describes popular music that is influenced by African culture even though the styles keep changing. That, however, does not mean that it cannot include non-African sources.
