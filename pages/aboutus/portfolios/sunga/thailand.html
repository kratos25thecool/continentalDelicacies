<h2>How to go</h2>
 <blockquote><p>From 7 December, travelers from 56 countries can now enter Thailand under the Visa Exemption Scheme. Passport holders from these countries are not required to obtain a visa when entering Thailand for tourism purposes and will be permitted to stay in the Kingdom for a period not exceeding 45 days. Some other countries may be eligible for stays of up to 90 days.

Travelers from countries not on the visa exemption list can apply for a Special Tourist Visa (SVT).

However, all travelers still need to comply with Thailand's 14-day mandatory quarantine and show proof of a negative PCR test. See below for additional requirements.

Anyone eligible to enter must obtain a Certificate of Entry (COE) from their local Thai embassy or consulate. Your application should be submitted at least 10 working days prior to the intended date of travel. Travelers who have received the COE must download the ThailandPlus contact tracing app and register.</p></blockquote>
