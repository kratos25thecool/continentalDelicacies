                <b>Avatar</b> is an American animated television series produced by <u>Nickelodeon Animation Studios</u>. 
                It was co-created by <em>Michael Dante DiMartino</em> and <em>Bryan Konietzko</em>, with <em>Aaron Ehasz</em> as head writer. 
                It aired on <u>Nickelodeon</u> for three seasons, from February 2005 to July 2008.
                Avatar is set in an Asiatic-like world in which some people can manipulate one of the 
                four elements—water, earth, fire, or air—with telekinetic variants of the Chinese martial arts known as <em>bending</em>.

                This is one of my most anticipated cartoon when I was a kid. Mainly because of how cool the martial arts/bending looked like.
                I have some fond memories of doing those moves along with a childhood friend. We'd play as benders and fight each other. 
                Sometimes on windy days where dried leaves gets blown around, we'd pretend to airbend them away.

                <b>Phineas and Ferb</b> is an American animated musical comedy television series created by <em>Dan Povenmire</em>  
                and <em>Jeff "Swampy" Marsh</em> for <u>Disney Channel</u> and <u>Disney XD</u>. The program follows Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother
                Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation. Every day, the boys embark on some grand new project; 
                these are usually unrealistic given the protagonists' ages and are sometimes downright physically impossible. 
                Which annoys their controlling older sister Candace, who frequently tries to reveal their shenanigans 
                to her and Phineas' mother, Linda Flynn-Fletcher.

                This is the show I've watched the most. It used to air two episodes back to back at 6:30AM, exactly the time I have to wake up for my elementary
                school days. I've practically memorized every one of their songs, all because I'd hear it half asleep while trying catch some Zs for 5 more minutes.

                <b>Shrek</b> is a 2001 American computer-animated comedy film loosely based on the 1990 
                fairy tale picture book of the same name by William Steig. Shrek premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival and
                was widely praised as an animated film that featured adult-oriented humor and themes, while catering to children at the same time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Yep, this isn't a meme. I actually liked this movie. It's a tale of an ogre, a supposedly aggresive and hideous creature,
                saving a princess and finding <em>true love</em> in each other. Loving another regardless of their flaws, accepting them
                and them accepting yours. Now that's a love story even a loveless <strike>KHV</strike> like me could get behind. Truly an inspiring movie. Everytime
                I watch it I get the feeling that maybe I'd make it someday.

                <b>Bolt</b> is a 2008 American computer animated comedy-adventure film 
                produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.
                Bolt was released in the United States on November 21, 2008. Despite a relatively marginal box-office performance, 
                the film received a strong positive critical reception and is renowned for playing an important role in instigating 
                what is widely referred to as the Disney Revival, as well as setting the studio in a new creative direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ah yes, I really do enjoy watching <em>Bolt</em> every now and again. It's got action, drama, and all the other stuff
                that I really want in. I practically watch it every week, mostly because my little cousin here just adores the little dog. 
                And he's got a lot of toys to show for it, well he confuses every 3d dog cartoon with Paw Patrol but still.
