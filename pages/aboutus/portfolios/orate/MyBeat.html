                <b>Soft Rock</b> also known as light rock and adult-oriented rock
                is a derivative form of pop rock that originated in the late 1960s
                in the U.S. region of Southern California and in the United Kingdom. 
                The style smoothed over the edges of singer-songwriter and pop rock
                relying on simple, melodic songs with big, lush productions.

                <b>Electro</b> or electro-funk is a genre of electronic music
                and early hip hop directly influenced by the use of 
                the Roland TR-808 drum machines and funk. 
                Records in the genre typically feature drum machines 
                and heavy electronic sounds, usually without vocals.
                It is less vocal-oriented and more focused on 
                electronic beats produced by drum machines.
