				<sup>1</sup>I was born in 2001 into a nuclear family. 
				<sup>2</sup>I lived with my father, mother, and soon after, my sister.
				<sup>3</sup>I am very thankful to my parents for showering us with love and more than our needs. 
				<sup>4</sup>My mother used to work abroad and was essentially a very <em>adventurous</em> person. 
				<sup>5</sup>Despite that, she decided to stay here in the Philippines to properly raise us herself. 
				<sup>6</sup>My father was one to both work and pursue knowledge. 
				<sup>7</sup>He works as a professor in UE Manila and, at the time, completing his Doctorate degree. 
				<sup>8</sup>My sister was born in 2004, she always liked drawing and has grown to be quite the artist.
				<sup>9</sup>I started Nursery in a learning center at the age of <strong>four</strong>.
				<sup>10</sup>My mother has always been <i>pushy</i> about academics so by the time I finished nursery, I was able to read and write.
				<sup>11</sup>It was the reason why I was able to get <i>accelerated</i>.
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<sup>1</sup>In my childhood, I was able to play outside a <b>whole lot</b>. 
				<sup>2</sup>My friends and I used to play outdoor games almost everyday. 
				<sup>3</sup>Games like hide-and-seek, tom sawyer, <i>agawan base, mataya-taya, patintero, tumbang preso,</i> and many more. 
				<sup>4</sup>The one I enjoyed the most was <u>hide-and-seek</u>. 
				<sup>5</sup>It’s because I’ve always loved crawling into tight spaces looking for places to hide.
				<sup>6</sup>We used to live in a condominium area so there were lots of children and lots of places to hide in.
				<sup>7</sup>In the early 2010s, there was some <u>news about earthquakes</u> hitting our area.
				<sup>8</sup>Seeing as some of those condo buildings were starting to <em>crack</em>, we decided to move.
				<sup>9</sup>From our modest condominium, my parents were able to afford a nice home in a multiplex subdivision where we currently reside.
				<sup>10</sup>I remember how sad I was before moving because I might not be able to see my friends again.

				<sup>1</sup>After we moved I, of course, had to <u>change schools</u>.
				<sup>2</sup>Admittedly being <em>socially inept</em>, it was a struggle to fit in.
				<sup>3</sup>Since everyone in my new school already knew one another since elementary school.
				<sup>4</sup>As I began to move into my adolescent years, I tried to become more independent.
				<sup>5</sup>Despite the difficulties, I managed to make some friends
				<sup>6</sup>Being honest, I was very influenced by them.
				<sup>7</sup>Well, we didn’t do anything <em>bad</em> but my interests have started to shift.
				<sup>8</sup>I became more into <u>online gaming and anime</u>.
				<sup>9</sup>The complete opposite of my childhood when I used to run <b>outside</b> the whole day, I started to become an <b>indoor</b> person.
				<sup>10</sup>Now I spend most of my time on my <u>computer and phone</u>.
				<sup>11</sup>Even so, I feel like these highschool friends I made will last a <b>lifetime</b>.
				<sup>12</sup>Even when I am already in college, we still contact and talk with each other almost everyday.

				<sup>1</sup>After finishing high school, I entered <strong>University of the East</strong> for my senior year.
				<sup>2</sup>I managed to make some friends for myself this time.
				<sup>3</sup>It was a relatively large group.
				<sup>4</sup>There were about <u>ten</u> of us.
				<sup>5</sup>It was <em>fun</em>, getting to know all sorts of people.
				<sup>6</sup>But unfortunately, my friend group <i>grew apart</i> by graduation.
				<sup>7</sup>Still though, I feel lucky to be able to contact them every once in a while.
				<sup>8</sup>One of them also continued college in UE as a GameDev student.

			<u>College Years</u>

			<blockquote>
				
				<sup>1</sup>I started college at 17 and enrolled as a <b>Computer Science</b> student.
				<sup>2</sup>I know I have been influenced to start online gaming.
				<sup>3</sup>But through that influence, I found my <em>interest</em> in <u>computer programming</u>.
				<sup>4</sup>That and <em>future prospects</em> are what pushed me to pursue computer science.
				<sup>5</sup>As for my <b>academics</b>, my mother has always told me to follow my fathers footsteps and study as hard as I can. 
				<sup>6</sup>Considering my father accomplished Summa cum Laude, I am not very confident I can follow him. 
				<sup>7</sup>I <em>may</em> have gotten his smarts, but <strong>not</strong> his hard work. 
				<sup>8</sup>I will admit that I am a lazy bum. 
				<sup>9</sup>This activity is proof of that, which I did four hours into the deadline.

			<blockquote>
				<sup>1</sup>My first year of college went <em>well</em> enough.
				<sup>2</sup>Although I did not do too well in the entrance exam, I managed to become a candidate for a college scholarship for the whole year.
				<sup>3</sup>Well, not that I needed it as I don’t need to pay tuition as part of my father’s benefits.
				<sup>4</sup>For my second year, we all know how the <strong>pandemic</strong> hit every one of us.
				<sup>5</sup>Although, I haven’t really felt down because of the lockdowns as I am an <u>indoor person</u>.
				<sup>6</sup>This whole 2nd year being online classes has given me much more free time.
				<sup>7</sup>I used to commute from home to school which is about <strong>2 hours</strong> each way because of the traffic.
				<sup>8</sup>But I’ve got to agree with others, I think that classes being online have made learning more <em>difficult</em>.
				<sup>9</sup>This is because of the amount of work that keeps piling up.
				<sup>10</sup>Proper time management and not slacking off would definitely help though.
				<sup>11</sup>I’m now treating these times as a chance to improve my character and learn how to do <u>actual work</u>.
