		The experiences of my past are <mark><strong>undeniable</mark></strong>.<b><sup>[1.]</sup></b> It goes without saying that my childhood was more than just a learning experience.<b><sup>[2.]</sup></b> 
		These are my greatest memories! This story is not only on my childhood but also about the lessons I have learned throughout my childhood.<b><sup>[3.]</sup></b>
		My name is Alvino Bautista, I grew up in Province of <i>Bulacan</i> with my three siblings.<b><sup>[4.]</sup></b> I was the youngest of them all.<b><sup>[5.]</sup></b> 
		My family calls me <b>'Kambal'</b>, because I have twin brother, and his name is <b>'Alfonso'</b>.<b><sup>[6.]</sup></b> We are identical twins, that's why many people said that we are very much alike on each other.<b><sup>[7.]</sup></b> I remeber when my twin and I were young.<b><sup>[8.]</sup></b> We were often have the same design and color of clothes, because my mother wants it.<b><sup>[9.]</sup></b> 
		As we were growing up having same clothes or even other things.<b><sup>[10.]</sup></b> At some point we started complaining to our parents because our friends often noticed our clothes, and sometimes we were tease because of it.<b><sup>[11.]</sup></b> We are also often compared to each other.<b><sup>[12.]</sup></b>
		Because I use to be more chubby than my twin brother and because of that my older siblings tease me.<b><sup>[13.]</sup></b> I can also say that I used to be a naughty child.<b><sup>[14.]</sup></b> 
		My parents often scold me for not following what they say for me.<b><sup>[15.]</sup></b> Times when I was on outside all day playing with my friends.<b><sup>[16.]</sup></b> 
		Times when I don't even want to go home, because I still want to be with them.<b><sup>[17.]</sup></b>Times when I always cry, because my father will go to other country for work.<b><sup>[18.]</sup></b>
		Those small memories of my childhood days are still fresh in my mind.<b><sup>[19.]</sup></b> Although I do wish that those days, full of pleasure, come back, I know that it is a thing of the past.<b><sup>[20.]</sup></b> 
	<b><mark>Time flies on wings</mark></b>.<b><sup>[21.]</sup></b> I have to move on.<b><sup>[22.]</sup></b>

		For me teenage years are the best years of one's life'.<b><sup>[1.]</sup></b> I use to be full of vitality and energy.<b><sup>[2.]</sup></b>
		This advantage allows me to conquer the world literally, experience new <mark><b>insights</mark></b>, <b><mark>gain wisdom</mark></b> and <b><mark>acquire knowledge<mark></b>.<b><sup>[3.]</sup></b>
		When I become a teenager my mind has grown a bit, unlike before when I was a child.<b><sup>[4.]</sup></b> Here I experienced various things that other teenagers often experience.<b><sup>[5.]</sup></b>
		Like physical changes in my body as well as emotional changes.<b><sup>[6.]</sup></b> 
		This is also where my number of friends increased.<b><sup>[7.]</sup></b> Friends I often associate with.<b><sup>[8.]</sup></b>
		Friends who taught me other things I had never been discovered.<b><sup>[9.]</sup></b> 
		I still remember those times, after school, me and my classmates would go to our friend's house and there we would chat and have a snack until night.<b><sup>[10.]</sup></b>
		We can say that those things are simple, but I also missed to go back in those times.<b><sup>[11.]</sup></b> 
		This is also where I became more involved in sports like basketball, and because of this we became champions in our intramurals at my school when I was in grade 9.<b><sup>[12.]</sup></b>
		Aside from basketball, I also love biking with my friends.<b><sup>[13.]</sup></b> I often get scolded for biking because I travel so far and I don't even wear an helmet sometimes.<b><sup>[14.]</sup></b>
		I also started here to take care myself, mostly in physical aspect.<b><sup>[15.]</sup></b> Like buying clothes or shoes for myself, because I have crush on someone.<b><sup>[16.]</sup></b> 
		This also the years were I got to choose, what career should I pursue in college.<b><sup>[17.]</sup></b>
		In my case, I choose as to be a computer science student.<b><sup>[18.]</sup></b> Overall I can say that my teenage life was so <mark><strong>memorable</mark></strong> and <strong><mark>unforgettable</mark></strong> experience of my life.<b><sup>[19.]</sup></b> If I can go back the time, I will still choose to be a teenager.<b><sup>[20.]</sup></b>

		I can say that College life is a <strong><mark>big transition</mark></strong> from school life for me....<b><sup>[1.]</sup></b> I go through a lot of changes when my first year as college student.<b><sup>[2.]</sup></b>  
		I can still remeber the time when, I was on my freshmen year, I'm so nervous, because of the bad things I heard before about college life.<b><sup>[3.]</sup></b>  
		Things that are so different in highschool life.<b><sup>[4.]</sup></b> They say the professors here are more strict.<b><sup>[5.]</sup></b> The subjects here are more difficult.<b><sup>[6.]</sup></b> 
		For me I can say that I feel those things.<b><sup>[7.]</sup></b> I feel like the transition to college is so sudden for me, from being an average highschool student to college student.<b><sup>[8.]</sup></b>
		College life poses a lot of challenges in front of you.<b><sup>[9.]</sup></b> My feelings at first is that, I'm in a place full of unfamiliar faces where I need to mingle in , because they are still new to me.<b><sup>[10.]</sup></b> But not all the bad things we hear about college life are true, it's all about how we can adapt the new learning environment in front of us.<b><sup>[11.]</sup></b>
		I can say that college teaches me to socialize and form opinions on my own.<b><sup>[12.]</sup></b> In college, I learn to express my feelings and become more confident and composed.<b><sup>[13.]</sup></b>
		Unlike before, I used to be dependant on my friends or teachers <b><sup>[14.]</sup></b> College life teaches me to be <strong>independent</strong>.<b><sup>[15.]</sup></b> It makes me stronger and teaches me to fight my own battles.<b><sup>[16.]</sup></b> This is where I find my true friends.<b><sup>[17.]</sup></b> Friends who always their when you need them the most.<b><sup>[18.]</sup></b> 
		It also makes me to become more serious about my careers in life.<b><sup>[19.]</sup></b> I can make my own decisions now, that will affect my future, as in school life before, our parents did it for us.<b><sup>[20.]</sup></b> In summary, Now as a 2nd year <strong><abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr></strong> student, I can say that college has enriched my life in many ways.<b><sup>[21.]</sup></b> 
		It has provided me with the necessary tools to enhance my <mark>skills</mark> more, taught me <mark>valuable knowledge</mark> about this diverse world and people and concepts in general and eventually will enable me to hopefully become more <mark>successful</mark> in life when I finally graduate and get my degree.<b><sup>[22.]</sup>
