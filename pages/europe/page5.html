                        <h1>Köttbullar in Sweden.</h1>
                        <p>Köttbullar med gräddsås (meatballs with cream sauce) is widely thought of as Sweden's national dish. Köttbullar are smaller and have a diferent flavour to Italian meatballs and are nearly always served with a cream sauce. The recipe first appeared in a book by the legendary Cajsa Warg, published in 1755, and has been a firm favourite ever since.

                        Unfortunately, the Swedish Chef on The Muppet Show demonstrated to the world how to cook them, whilst singing in semi-comprehensible gibberish in a mock-Swedish accent! And what did we learn? Swedish meatballs are only fit for tennis!
                        <br><br>
                        Of course, that is not true. When made by a skilled chef, like Stefano Catenacci at Operabaren in Stockholm, köttbullar are light, delicate and a real treat. He serves them in a traditional style, with potato purée, sweetened lingonberries and pressed cucumber. Personally, I think Operabaren, with its beautifully maintained Art Nouveau interior, is the best places in the world to enjoy köttbullar.
