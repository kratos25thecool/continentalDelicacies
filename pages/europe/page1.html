                        traditional authentic Hungarian goulash recipe soup stew beef gulyas
                        <br><br>
                        Traditional Hungarian goulash is a prime example of how a few simple ingredients, cooked properly, can yield an incredible flavor.  Though many variations of Hungarian goulash exist, and every cook makes it just a bit differently, this is a traditional, authentic recipe from the heart of Hungary.

                        You already know how much I love Hungary from previous Hungarian recipes I’ve posted so I’ll spare you some of the sentimentality this time.  Needless to say, Hungary holds a special place in my heart, in my family’s hearts.  My brother lived there for 2 years as a young man, regularly wrote home to us about his experiences there, the beautiful scenery and breathtaking buildings, his love for the Hungarian people.  When I visited Budapest I immediately fell in love with it.  It has become one of my most favorite European cities.  Its name comes from the two sides of the city (Buda and Pest) separated by the Danube River running through it.  I don’t know that any city has a more breathtaking site than Budapest’s famous chain bridge, its parliament building, and the incredible Buda Castle.
