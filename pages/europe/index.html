                <h3>Köttbullar in Sweden.</h3>
                <p>Swedish meatballs were made seriously popular by IKEA, but we think they still don’t get the credit they deserve. Made with cream and breadcrumbs soaked in milk, these are super tender and traditionally served with gravy, boiled potatoes, lingonberry jam, and sometimes fresh pickled cucumber. Get us to Sweden ASAP!

                <h3>Haggis in Scotland.</h3>
                <p>Okay, so Haggis sounds kind of unappealing. But if any foods on this list will completely surprise you, it’s Haggis! Just give it a try if you find yourself in Scotland – you won’t be disappointed. Enjoy it with an obligatory side of ‘neeps and tatties’, of course.
