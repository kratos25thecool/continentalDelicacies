                        <p>Ćevapi is an old-fashioned dish that originates from almost unknown parts and is known as Ćevapičići. It is believed that ćevapi were introduced to Bosnian cuisine through the Ottoman Empire, which was present in the Balkan area for almost 500 years.
                        <br><br>
                        It is also said that the inspiration for ćevapi comes from oriental koftas, but the Bosnians have adjusted it to meet their preferences for flavor and texture. It’s all up for debate depending on where you live. In any case, these skinless sausages are delicious.
