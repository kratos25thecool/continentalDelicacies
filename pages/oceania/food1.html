     <p style="text-align:justify;">Melt the marshmallows and water in a large bowl over simmering water. Take off the heat and stir the mixture. Leave to cool for a few minutes.
Sift in half the Chelsea Icing Sugar to help stiffen the paste. This is quite tricky as the mixture is very sticky. Just keep adding icing sugar to help unstick things. When the dough is firm enough to handle, transfer to a tabletop sprinkled with a generous amount of icing sugar.</p>
     <p class="mb-4" style="text-align:justify;">Knead the dough while slowly sieving more icing sugar over the dough as necessary.
Add yellow colouring and pineapple flavouring to taste.</p>
     <p class="mb-4" style="text-align:justify;">Roll to the thickness that you want and cut into rectangles or any other shape you want.
Melt the chocolate and leave to cool for a little while (so it doesn't melt the pineapple lumps).
Dip each piece in chocolate and leave to harden.</p>
