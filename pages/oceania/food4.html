      <p class="mb-4"style="text-align:justify;">Although kangaroos have been hunted for their meat by the Indigenous Australians for many generations, kangaroo meat wasn’t legalised for human consumption until 1980 in Southern Australia, followed by other states in 1993. However, prior to this, recipes featuring kangaroo meat appeared quite regularly in cookbooks throughout Australia until the 1930s. During this time, kangaroo soup was highly sought after – a stew made from kangaroo that was enriched with salt pork, making it full of flavor. Due to an overpopulation of kangaroos, through population control programs, licensed shooters are able to hunt the animal through a very strict code of practice. Kangaroos are legally protected from non-Aboriginal hunting, allowing Aboriginal communities to continue with their cultural traditions. Protected by both state and federal legislation in Australia, of the 48 species of kangaroo in the country, only five of these species can be commercially harvested.</p>

      <p class="tm-text-color-white small tm-font-thin mb-0"> Kangaroo is a gamey meat, and some foodies even prefer it to lamb and steak for its tenderness and taste. It tends to be a stronger flavour than beef or lamb, and even though it is a very lean meat, it's not tough like venison can sometimes be.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;"> Aussies described Kangaroo as taste quite like steak. Kangaroo is a gamey meat, and some foodies even prefer it to lamb and steak for its tenderness and taste. It tends to be a stronger flavour than beef or lamb, and even though it is a very lean meat, it's not tough like venison can sometimes be.<p>
