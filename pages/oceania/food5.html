      <p class="mb-4"style="text-align:justify;">Historically, Palau’s protein came almost exclusively from fish. Over time, it became a country with some exquisite seafood.
This became a little too tedious and limiting, however, as there were few meat options apart from fish. Therefore, many people in the region took to eating bats as an alternate source of protein. The small fruit bats, that the dish consists of, reside in forested areas at the top of trees.  While most kinds of bats eat insects, fruit bats consume wild fruits, flowers and nectar as their main diet, and hence help with the distribution of seeds during the process. Fruit bat soup has historically been the staple of the locals’ diet in Palau. However, it is now seen as more of a delicacy.</p>

      <p class="tm-text-color-white small tm-font-thin mb-0">Fruit bat soup is a Palau delicacy made with small fruit bats who reside in forested areas at the top of trees. They consume nectar, flowers, and wild fruits, helping with the distribution of seeds during the process. The bats' diet of flowers and fruits also results in their meat being sweeter than the meat of other bats.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">People at Palau said that the flavor of Fruit bat soup is somewhat similar to chicken soup. Since the bats are clean animals that live solely on fruits, young leaves and nectar – their meat tastes wickedly sweet. And it makes for an interesting dish.<p>

     <h2 class="mb-4 tm-text-color-primary">Method of Cooking</h2>
     <p style="text-align:justify;">The soup is prepared by boiling the washed bats in water, then cooking them with ginger, coconut milk, and various spices (and often vegetables) depending on the cook's preferences. It is typically served in large bowls, with the bat staring at your face, and the proper way to eat it is to chew the bat, sucking the meat out in the process and discarding the leftover fur.</p>
